  This is an authentication module for the Squid proxy server
! to authenticate users on an NT domain.
  
  <P>
  It originates from the Samba and SMB packages by Andrew Tridgell
! and Richard Sharpe. This version is sourced from the Pike
! authentication module by William Welliver (hwellive@intersil.com).
  
  <P>
  Usage is simple. It accepts a username and password on standard input.

  'Make install' will put 'msntauth' into

! Hopefully nobody has problems compiling msntauth.
  
  <A NAME="compiling"><H2>Issues when compiling</H2>
  
  <P>
! The Makefile uses the GCC compiler, and assumes that it is in the current PATH.
! Msntauth is known to compile properly on Redhat Linux 6, and FreeBSD 3.1
! without problems. Other operating systems are untested,
! but use a recent copy of the GNU C compiler.
! In Smbencrypt.c, '#include <sys/vfs.h>' only gets included when
! compiled with Solaris.
  
  <P>
! When compiling under Solaris, the socket libraries must be linked to.
! In the Makefile, hash the default CFLAGS line, and unhash the Solaris
! CFLAGS line. It always helps to have /usr/ccs/bin in your path
! prior to compiling.
  
  <P>
  For Digital Unix/Tru64, review the INSTALL line in the makefile.
  
  <A NAME="configuration"><H2>Configuration file</H2>
  
  <P>
! Msntauth uses a configuration file as of version 2.
! The file is /usr/local/squid/etc/msntauth.conf.
! If this path needs to be changed, it is defined in confload.c -
  
  <PRE>
    #define CONFIGFILE   "/usr/local/squid/etc/msntauth.conf"
